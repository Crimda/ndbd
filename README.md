NoteDB System
=============

##Dependancies##
[Wazu Python Standard Library](git://wazu.info.tm/wst.git)

##Intro##
I wrote this tool basically to act as a sort of custom
mail-list/forums/email/note tracker/etc.
I was planning on using it to help me keep notes, and
more importantly, actually keep track of reasons _Why_
I change things, sort of simulating how I talk to myself
rather than acting as a cold flat database. In essence,
I am going to be talking to myself and debating with
myself with this tool.

This contains two seperate programs:
*	Extremely bare-bones client: *bbclient*
* The actual server: *ndbd*

There is a basic example configuration in */cfg*, and
some documentation, probably more like notes really, in
*docs*.

##Installation##
See `make` for instructions here.

##Basic use##
Start the server.
Connect clients.
Do work billy.

Notedb manuscript/notes
so, we basically need a simple system for doing msg boards and what not.

how does a message board, or even a forum work?

Well, it takes a single document, and appends the post stuff to said document.
To create a new post, simply create a new document.

To create a new branch, simply create a new folder.

For security purposes, best to limit directory depth, perhaps to 10.

We could simply append posts to the file,

For example:
   Wazubaba - 07 Mar, Sat 02:54:30
   This is a sample note. It will act as an example, and will
   consist of two lines and 93 chars.

   This is a response to that post, which essentially contributes
   absolutely nothing to the conversation, but acts as a rather
   useful example text body.

   Ohai, I see that! ^^


Basically, every new post, append a newline followed by 58 ‘=’s
for legibility



There will be a simple web server system in place to send the posts as html,
for convieniance. This will be read-only however.

It will be a function which ‘render()’’s the post file into a valid html sheet.
